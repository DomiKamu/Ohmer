--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-release v2.0.0-beta 4 (October 18th, 2021)

- Builds against Rack-SDK-2.git.219bbaf1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-release v2.0.0 Beta (October 5th, 2021)

- Added code for "loadFont" in "draw" method (KlokSpid, Metriks, and RKD modules). Recommended for V2 migration.
- Added bypasses for KlokSpid (CLK -> all outputs), Metriks (IN -> OUT), and RKD (CLK -> all outputs).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-release v2.0.0 Beta (October 1st, 2021)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.1.6 (January 27th, 2020):

- RKD module: fixed high CPU load when CLK is patched, by refreshing all (8) displays every 32 frames (GitHub issue #3). Other
  features remain as realtime, however.
- BRK module: fixed inversion of mechanical switches (Max Div 16 and Max Div 32).
- RKD with BRK module removed (indicated as "deprecated" in future from previous 1.1.3.1).
- Plugin compiled against Rack v1.1.6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.1.3.1 (July 29th, 2019):

- New module BRK, as RKD "expander". This 4 HP module can be placed at right-side of RKD, or at left-side (if both, left
  side is ignored however). When RKD jumpers set-up (via BRK) is done, BRK can be removed.
- RKD-BRK module (8 HP) continues to exist for patch compatibility, BUT WILL BE DEPRECATED!
  during migration (by replacing all RKD-BRK by simple RKD in your patches is highly recommended).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.1.3 (July 26th, 2019):

- Metriks: fixed potential crash (Linux) when switching to "CV Tuner" mode.
- Metriks: for Voltmeter, new option (1st) is added: Realtime (default), Minimum, Maximum, or Median.
- Metriks: added manual (links from main README.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.1.2 (July 21st, 2019):

- Metriks: C++ code entirely rewritten (but still in progress) from scratch, more user-frienly...
- Metriks: MODE button becomes OPT. (options), to change possible option(s) for current mode (please note BPM meter doesn't
  have option, by the OPT. button doesn't have effect on "BPM Meter" mode).
- Metriks: for now, only "Voltmeter" and "CV Tuner" modes are operational (other modes - under construction - are disabled).
- Splitter 1x9: fixed output jack #9 "duplicate portID" issue (conflict vs. output jack #8).
- Splitter 1x9: re-implemented clipping LED (when input voltage is out of -11.7 V / +11.7 V range, red LED lits 0.5s min.).
- KlokSpid: now default (when added on rack) is "Custom" jack rates (/4, x1, x2 and x4), instead of "All @ x1".
- plugin.json: some module descriptions has been reworked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.0 (June 24th, 2019):

- All modules has been converted against VCV Rack v1.0.0.
- KlokSpid: memory leak issue is fixed.
- Splitter 1x9 and blank plates now have six models (GUI theme), identical to KlokSpid and Metriks modules.
- KlokSpid, Metriks and Splitter 1x9 modules now embed new jacks (silver or gold, following buttons and screws).
  Thanks to Xavier Belmont for SVG graphics, thanks also to Marc Boulé (ImpromptuModular) for C++ coding.
- Enhanced gold/silver buttons for KlokSpid and Metriks.
- Revamped context-menus (right-click menu).
- Splitter 1x9: support both monophonic and polyphonic cables (no SIMD).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.4 (April 28th, 2018):

- KlokSpid: added individual ratios (per output jack) while running as BPM-clock generator (changed via SETUP). When running
  as clock modulator, for now individual ratios remain as x1 (all identical).
- KlokSpid: additional display is added between output jacks, to display ratio (and LFO on jack #4 if applicable).
- KlokSpid: LFO on jack #4 is enabled only if its ratio is x1 (otherwise priority is given to ratio).
- KlokSpid: enhanced afterglow for red LED (CLK).
- KlokSpid, Metriks: background DMD (dot matrix display) now is more dark for Deepblue Signature models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.3 (April 8th, 2018):

- KlokSpid: added new feature: optional LFO to jack #4 (BPM-clock generator only). Can be enabled via SETUP.
- KlokSpid, Metriks: added initialization blinking (fake "Calibrating...") message on DMD, while encoder isn't stable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.2 (April 2st, 2018):

- KlokSpid: reworked encoder routine, better but not perfect, really a pain because knobs & encoders are badly implemented
  (why as modified knob ? why no auto rescale to "0.0" - neutral - on mouse release for an encoder?, why it uses - like knobs
  the stupid transient values during instanciation?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.1 (April 1st, 2018):

- KlokSpid: knob is replaced by a continuous encoder.
- KlokSpid: redesigned dot-matrix display, same frame of mind than Metriks.
- KlokSpid: new ratios (when set ky know, duh'... by encoder): 12, 15, and 24 (as divider and multiplier).
- KlokSpid: fixed model selection from context-menu.

NOTE: developments/maintenances around previous v0.5.x (for VCV Rack v0.5.1) are cancelled!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.0 (March 28th, 2018):

- KlokSpid: fixed BPM-clock generator sometimes is very long to start (was due to smooth knob moves during initialization).
- RKD modules: fixed issue concerning Max Div, when 8 (default J3/J4 On), and Spread On (J5), Max Div now is fixed to 16
  (required for auto-reset sequence, when enabled/On by jumper J6).
- New module (0.6 only): Metriks (voltmeter and peak counter operatioal, frequency meter stays in development).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.0.7-beta (March 25th, 2018):

- KlokSpid: fixed BPM-clock generator sometimes is very long to start (was due to knob/encoder initialization).
- KlokSpid: default (factory) waveform now is square wave ("Square W." from Setup), instead of "Gate 1/4" previously.
- RKD modules: added counting down feature for trigger mode.
- RKD modules: reworked RESET jack routine behavior (buffered).
- RKD modules: RESET LED was replaced by... tri-colored (red, orange, blue), red for module timeout (aka no source CLK),
  orange for incoming trigger on RESET jack, and blue when "Auto-Reset" is fired (if enabled via JP6 or switch on BRK panel).
- RKD modules: Max Div forced to 64 for all extra tables (required for "Auto-Reset" on these tables, too).
- RKD modules: "Auto-Reset" sequence is fully optimized.
- RKD modules: Added 5th table: "Triplet & 16ths": 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Having 8 possible rotations.
- RKD modules: implemented adaptative "Max Div" for "Prime numbers" table, may be 32 or 64 (based on highest current divider).
- RKD module only (not applicable for RKD with "Break"): state of PCB view is saved/recalled.
- RKD module only (not applicable for RKD with "Break"): jumpers are always read at begining of module's step() method, to
  avoid issues on some dividers when cloning RKD module while its PCB isn't visible.
- New (experimental) module: Metriks (WIP) - for continuous encoder training... working as voltmeter for now...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.0.6-beta (March 19th, 2018):

- RKD modules: pulsing engine entirely redesigned.
- RKD modules: RESET jack and Auto-Reset features are operational.
- RKD modules: added a bi-colored LED near RESET jack: red on full module reset (or disabled/idle), cyan during "Auto-Reset"
  (if configured by jumper J6 ON, or via switch on BRK panel).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.0.5-beta (March 17th, 2018):

- Introduced two new modules: RKD (Rotate Klok Divider), and RKD with "Break". Both inspired by 4ms' RCD and RCDBO modules.
  With limited permission allowed by 4ms Company (thanks!).
- KlokSpid: fixed issue when "Signature" module was choosen from context-menu, then the module was cloned, resulting bad text
  color in DMD instead of "plasma-like" color (white, orange or cyan).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.0.4-beta (March 8th, 2018):

- KlokSpid: single green/red LED replaces two separate green & red LEDs, as SYNC indicator.
- KlokSpid: during SETUP operations, SYNC LED continues to report synchronization status.
- KlokSpid: added +2V as possible output voltage. Appears from "Out Voltg." setting, in module's SETUP.
- KlokSpid: fixed issue when knob affects pulse duration (clock multiplier only) when editing any setting from SETUP.
- KlokSpid: 2s hold button to enter/quick exit module's SETUP, is fixed.
- KlokSpid: Fixed SVG cosmetic, for all panels, concerning two serigraphy lines above CV-RATIO/TRIG. port. Now both lines are
  correctly aligned on the port edge!
- KlokSpid: now default factory for CV-RATIO/TRIG. input port, TRIG. is BPM-clocking reset, instead of BPM start/stop toggle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.0.3-beta (February 28th, 2018):

- Source code initially designed for Rack v0.5.1 was migrated against Rack v0.6 API.
- Merged KlokSpid sources, now once KlokSpid as "common base", model (GUI variation) can be changed anytime via context-menu.
- Now KlokSpid family is six models (panl theme & DMD variations), befault is Classic (beige, like blank panels & splitter).
- Maximum possible voltage on outputs can be delivered is +11.7V (displayed +12V from SETUP menu), due to protection diodes.
  More infos: https://vcvrack.com/manual/VoltageStandards.html
- Trigger voltage thresholds are set +1.7V for high state, +0.2V for low state.
- Limited context-menus are removed (Andrew recommendation, in order to keep a standard for every Rack module).
- KlokSpid: "Initialize" (Ctrl+I, Command+I) and "Randomize" (Ctrl+R, Command+R) - context-menu - are (actually) bypassed!
- KlokSpid: long press/hold on button during SETUP does an "immediate Save/Exit".
- KlokSpid: CV-RATIO now covers all possible ratios from 1 to 64 (both divider and multiplier).
- Splitter 1x9: added a "clipping" red LED, near input port.
- Splitter 1x9: reworked port positions.
- 2 HP Blank Panel have a context-menu to change its screws setting (three settings).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO LIST / PLANNED:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Metriks: other modes (BPM Meter, Peak Counter, Frequency Counter).
- UNDER CONSIDERATION for Metriks: implementation of optional 432Hz (A4 Pitch) as reference for CV Tuner? (is it necessary?)
- UNDER CONSIDERATION for RKD module: YouTube video tutorial.
- KlokSpid, Metriks: PDF manual (also under consideration), and/or YouTube tutorial video (redo a separate dedicated video).
